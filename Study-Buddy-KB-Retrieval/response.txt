Some risks associated with cryptocurrencies, as described in the document, include:

1. **Investment Risks**: Cryptocurrencies have a high risk of loss because they are not backed by any government, and their value can fluctuate significantly over time. This lack of backing and the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies make them a risky investment, where one could potentially lose all invested capital [1].

2. **Lack of Regulation and Security**: Cryptocurrencies are not regulated by governmental authorities like traditional currencies. They are also vulnerable to theft or hacking due to their digital nature. Wallets and platforms for trading could be compromised, and there are no insurances or guarantees provided by the government. This situation could lead to loss of investment without any means of recovery [1].

3. **Scams**: Due to the anonymous nature of transactions, cryptocurrency users may be at a higher risk of falling prey to scams such as Ponzi schemes and "pump and dump" scams where the value of the cryptocurrency is artificially inflated to attract buyers, after which the organizers sell their holdings, causing the value to plummet. The public ledger keeping all transaction data does not display personal identifying information, which makes tracking and rectifying such scams difficult [1].

4. **Non-refundable Transactions**: Some transactions made with cryptocurrencies are non-refundable. This feature can lead to increased risks of fraud, where payment may be provided for products or services that are never delivered, and no recourse is available to the buyer [1].

5. **Mining Risks**: The mining of cryptocurrencies involves complex computer processes that can have their own sets of risks, including a high energy cost. Additionally, the potential for introducing malware through cryptojacking, where hackers use someone else's computing resources to mine cryptocurrency, is another risk associated with the mining aspect of cryptocurrencies [1].
