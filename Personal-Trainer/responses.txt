3. Fatty Fish: Salmon, mackerel, sardines, trout, and other fatty fish contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have numerous health benefits including heart health.

4. Olive oil: Extra virgin olive oil, especially when used in moderation, is a great source of monounsaturated fats and can be used in salad dressings, cooking, and drizzling over dishes.

5. Plant-based oils: Certain plant-based oils, like those derived from sunflower, safflower, sesame, or flaxseeds, can provide a good balance of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats.

6. Coconut oil: While high in saturated fat, coconut oil can be used in moderation. It has a unique composition of fatty acids and may have certain health benefits.

User: How often can one do a cheat meal? And what can be the contents of the same?
Assistant: The frequency and contents of cheat meals can vary depending on individual goals, preferences, and overall dietary patterns. Here are some general guidelines:

1. Frequency: The frequency of cheat meals can vary depending on your goals and overall diet adherence. Some people find benefit in having a cheat meal once a week or every two weeks, while others might prefer a more flexible approach such as incorporating occasional indulgences in small portions. It's important to strike a balance and not let cheat meals turn into overly frequent or excessive indulgences that may derail overall progress.

2. Portion control: Even during a cheat meal, it's important to practice portion control. While indulging in foods you enjoy, be mindful of your portion sizes. Avoid going overboard and aim to maintain a sense of moderation.

3. Satisfy cravings: Use your cheat meal as an opportunity to enjoy foods or dishes you may typically avoid within your regular diet. This can help prevent feelings of deprivation and ensure that your cheat meal is truly satisfying.

4. Balanced approach: While the purpose of a cheat meal is to indulge, it's still beneficial to include a balance of macronutrients. By incorporating some protein, healthy fats, and fiber along with indulgent items, you can still maintain a sense of balance and control over your food choices.

5. Enjoyment and flexibility: Allow yourself to truly enjoy your cheat meal without guilt. Remember that the purpose of a cheat meal is to provide a mental break and enjoyment in your eating habits. Embrace the flexibility and freedom to indulge in foods you may crave.

6. Individual preferences: What to include in your cheat meal depends on your personal preferences. It could involve foods like pizza, burgers, chocolate, ice cream, or any other indulgent items you enjoy. However, it's important to remember that balance and moderation are key.

Remember that individual needs and goals may differ, and it's important to listen to your body and find an approach to cheat meals that works best for you. Consulting with a registered dietitian can provide you with personalized guidance and recommendations based on your specific needs and preferences.
