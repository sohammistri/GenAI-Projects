       "Task decomposition for LLM (Large Language Model) agents refers to the process of breaking down a complex task into smaller, more manageable subtasks. This technique enhances the performance of LLMs on intricate tasks by allowing them to focus on simpler components one at a time. The concept is rooted in the \"Chain of Thought\" (CoT) prompting technique, which instructs the model to think step-by-step, thereby utilizing more test-time computation to dissect difficult tasks into simpler steps. This not only transforms large tasks into multiple manageable tasks but also provides insights into the modelâ€™s reasoning process.\n",

       "Further extending this concept, the \"Tree of Thoughts\" approach, as mentioned in the provided documents, explores multiple reasoning possibilities at each step of task decomposition. It generates a tree structure by creating multiple thoughts per step, which can be navigated using search strategies like breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS). Each state in this tree can be evaluated using methods such as classifier prompts or majority votes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Task decomposition can be implemented in various ways:\n",
       "1. By using simple LLM prompting techniques, such as asking for \"Steps for XYZ\" or querying about the subgoals for achieving a specific objective.\n",
       "2. By employing task-specific instructions, for example, instructing the model to \"Write a story outline\" for novel writing.\n",
       "3. Through human inputs, where the decomposition is guided by direct human interaction or oversight.\n",
       "\n",

       "1. **Chain of Thought (CoT)**: Introduced by Wei et al. in 2022, this technique involves prompting the model to \"think step by step.\" This method allows the model to use more test-time computation to break down complex tasks into smaller, simpler steps. The CoT approach helps in transforming large tasks into multiple manageable tasks and provides insights into the modelâ€™s reasoning process.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Tree of Thoughts**: An extension of the Chain of Thought, developed by Yao et al. in 2023. This method further explores multiple reasoning possibilities at each step of the task decomposition. It starts by breaking the problem into multiple thought steps and then generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process within this structure can be conducted using either breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS), with each state evaluated by a classifier (prompted) or by majority vote.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Simple Prompting Techniques**: These involve using straightforward prompts to guide the LLM in decomposing tasks. Examples include prompts like \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\" or \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\" These prompts are designed to elicit a structured breakdown of tasks directly from the LLM.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Task-Specific Instructions**: This approach uses instructions tailored to specific types of tasks to aid in decomposition. For example, instructing an LLM to \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel helps in structuring the task into manageable components.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Human Inputs**: Involving human participation in the task decomposition process. This can include humans providing initial inputs or corrections to the decomposed tasks suggested by the LLM, ensuring that the decomposition aligns with human understanding and requirements.\n",
